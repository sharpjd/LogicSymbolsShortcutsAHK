# Description
Small AHK script to make typing logical symbols easier via some intuitive RShift + letter key shortcuts (and various mostly abandoned keys on the keyboard such as RCtrl, RAlt, Fn)

# Usage
Download from the releases section (on the right-hand side of the page) or download the entire repository and run the .EXE 

The instructions should be displayed upon the app opening.

You can also just double-click the .ahk file to run it if you have AHK installed.
